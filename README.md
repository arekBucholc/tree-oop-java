# Tree OOP in Java

This project demonstrates a simple object-oriented model of trees, both deciduous (broadleaf) and coniferous (needle), implemented in Java 11. The trees have basic properties such as a trunk, branches, and leaves or needles, and methods to simulate growth and other behaviors.

## Features

- **Abstract class `Tree`**: Base class representing a generic tree, with fields for the trunk, number of branches, and type of leaves (represented as an `enum`).
- **`DeciduousTree` class**: Represents a deciduous (broadleaf) tree with methods to simulate growth and shedding leaves.
- **`ConiferousTree` class**: Represents a coniferous (needle) tree with methods to simulate growth of needles.
- **Enum `LeafType`**: Defines the two types of foliage: broadleaf for deciduous trees and needles for coniferous trees.
- Uses **JUnit 5** for unit testing.
